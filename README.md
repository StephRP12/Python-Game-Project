# Python Game Project
This game was made as a portfolio project for Codecademy. 

## Doors of Fate
Doors of Fate is a simple game where the user is asked to choose between two options. Each decision then leads to another choice until 10 decisions have been made, or until a 
particular decision has triggered another action. The user could win, lose, restart, or have a setback and have to make up to 3 additional choices. At the end, the
game will determine the user's fate based on the choices made. The game was implemented using Python and runs in the terminal.
